Task Management App (CLI-based)

## Project Overview

This is a simple *Task Management App* built using Python. It is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) program that allows users to:

- Add tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- View all tasks
- Exit the application

## What I Learned

### Python Basics
- Using input() to take user input.
- Displaying output with print().

### Data Structures
- Used *list* to store and manage tasks.
- Performed list operations like append(), index(), and del.

### Conditional Statements
- Used if-elif-else to handle multiple choices (menu system).

### Looping
- Used a while True loop to keep the program running until the user decides to exit.

### Error Handling
- Used try-except to handle invalid inputs (like entering text when a number is expected).

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or copy the task.py file.
3. Run the program
